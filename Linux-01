What is server ?
-----------------

A server "serves" data or services (like websites, files, emails or databases) to users or devices that request it.

Example:

	.Web server -> serves websites (e.g., Apache, Nginx)
	.Database server -> stores and manages data (e.g., MySQL, Postgres, microsoft etc)
	.File Server -> stores and shares files between servers
	.Mail server -> handles emails (e.g., Microsoft Exchange)
	.Application Server -> runs business logics 

Server Hardware Components:
---------------------------
	.CPU (brain of the server, exutes instructions and processes data)
	eg: Intel
	.RAM (stores data temporarily)
	.Motherboard (this is main circuit board that connects all components)
	.NIC
	.Storage Drives:(HDD-Hard disk Drive/SSD-Solid state drive)
	.Cooling system
	
Server software components:
---------------------------
	.OS(Operating systems) - 
		Linux distrubtions (ubuntu, redhat, centos, fedora, kali 600+)
		windows (by micro soft)
		Mac OS (Apple)
	
	The OS provides:
		.File system management
		.Process and memory managment
		.Network communication
		.security and user management
		
Type of server:			Example Software:			Function:
-------------------------------------------------------------
Web server				Apache, Nginx				Host websites
Database server			MySQL, PostreSQL			Stores and manages data
File server				samba, FTP, NFS				shares files and folders
Mail server				Microsoft, Postfix			sends and recives emails
Application server		Tomcat, WebLogic			Runs business applications
DNS server				BIND, Microsoft DNS			Resolves domain names		
		
		
A server Powerful with hardware + software desinged to provide contineous, reliable to clients

	.Hardware gives performance, reliability, and capacity
	.Software gives functionality, management and security

Creating Linux Server from AWS:
-------------------------------
Server Components: EC2: Elastic Compute Cloud:
----------------------------------------------
	-EC2 used to lauch virtual server when on-demand
	-EC2 support for multiple OS (like linux/windows/mac OS)
	-EC2 is very scalable and highly available and very powerful
	-EC2 is "pay-as-you-go"
	
Hardware components:
--------------------
	-CPU/RAM/Hard disk
Sofware components:
-------------------
	-OS (windows/Linux)
	
Steps to Configure AWS EC2 Instance:
------------------------------------
1.AWS Login
2.Name of the Instance
3.Application and OS Images (AMI-Amazon Machine Image)
	choose OS (windows/Linux-ubuntu)
4.Instance Type(Hardware):
	choose what is the RAM, VCPU's
	
What is an EC2 Instance Type?
Ans: instance type is like choose a "size" or "model" of the computer in the cloud.

this determine:
	.Number of vCPU's (virtual CPU's)
	.Amount of RAM (memory-2GB/4GB/6GB/12GB/16GB to 512GB)
	.Type of storage (EBS-Elastic Block store with HDD/SSD etc)
	.Network performance (bandwidth)
	.Pricing (pay-as-you-go or reserved)
	
	structure: sizes(nano, small, medium, large, xlarge, 2xlarge etc

Main Categories (Families) of EC2 instances:
--------------------------------------------
Family:					Examples:
---------------------------------
1.General Purpose		t4g, t3, m6i, m7g
2.Compute Optimized		c7g, c6i, c5
3.Memory Optimized		r7g, x2idn
4.Storage Optimized		i4i, d3
5.Accelerated			p5, g6


5.Key pair:
	-used to connect server
	-Two keys (public key and private key)
	
6.networking:
	-VPC (Virtual private Cloud)
	-Firewalls(Sg-security groups)
	
	protocols:
	1.SSH: secure shell used to connect instance, port No: 22
	2.HTTP: Hypertext transport protocol, used to access unsecured websites, port no: 80
	3.HTTPS:Hypertext transport protocol secure, used to access secured websites, port no: 443
	
	SSH: 22
	HTTP: 80
	HTTPS: 443
	
7.Configure Storage: EBS-Elastic Block store-HDD/SSD
	-EBS Volumes
	-Persistant block level storage
	-EBS size is 16TB
	-EBS volumes you create and attach to running EC2 instance upto 128 Volumes
	-Both EC2 and EBS volume should same region, then only you can attach 


After Create Instance connect to it using KEY-PAIR with public IP Address by third party application
	.pem: Mobexterm
	.PPK: putty

Introduction of Linux:
----------------------

what is operating sytem?
Ans:-The interface between user and hardware
	-Unix/Linux developed in the year 1960 under constant development
	-Unix/Linux is a multi-user, multi tasking operating system. you can have many users logged into a system simultaneously, each running many programmers.
	
Linux Architecture:
-------------------
Hardware: Consist of all hardware related information (CPU/RAM/HDD,SSD)
Kernel:Heart of the OS interacts with hardware
	   The core part of OS communication between hardware and software!
Shell:shell is the utility that process your request, you wont use linux OS, as a user you can not talk directly to the kernel, but you have some medium that is shell
Ex: if u want to create file/folder you create from shell using commands

shell uses standard syntax for all commands

Application layer: outer most layer is the application layer that executes the external application layer

Ex: mail server, FTP, DBMS etc


Note: Linux is all about files and directories(folders)

$ symbol is a normal user
To convert from normal user to root user "sudo su"	
# symbol is a root user
ctrl + d is to exit from root user

Topic1:Practicals of Basic File commands:
-----------------------------------------
ls
	.List files and directories

ls -al
	.List hidden files

ls -l
	.Long list all files and directories(with permissions)
	
touch
	.Create a empty file
	
cat>filename

	.Write content inside the file
	Exit: ctrl+c

cat filename
	.Display the file content
	
rm filename:
	.Remove files	
	
Topic2: Basic Directory(folders) commands:
------------------------------------------
mkdir
	.Create directories
	
cd directoryname
	.Switch to directory
	
pwd
	.print working directory/present working directory
	
	
rmdir
	.Removes empty directories

rm -r
	.Remove directories with files
		
rm -rf
	.Force delete directories (with files)
	
history
	.Display executed commands
	
Topic3: Identifying Linux File Types:
-------------------------------------
	-When you navigate the linux file system you are sure to encounter different file types.
	-The most used and obvious file types are "regular files and directories"
	
	Seven Types:
	-----------
	File Tyepe:				Symbol:
	-----------				-------
	1.Regular File			-
	2.Directory				d
	3.character device		c
	4.Block Device File		b
	5.Local Socket File		s
	6.Named Pipe			p
	7.Symbolic Link			l 
	
1.Regular File(-)
create an empty file:

command: touch file.txt

or 

command: echo "hello" > file1.txt

2.Directory(d)
create an directory

command: mkdir myfolder

3.character device(c)
---------------------
can create using mknod

command: sudo mknod mycharfile c 1 3

Note:
A character device file in linux represents a hardware device that sends or receive data(one byte) at a time.
Examples: keybord, mouse, USB devices

4.Block Device File(b)
----------------------
Same mknod command but type=b

command: sudo mknod myblockfile b 8 1

Note:
block device is a hardware device that reads and writes data in fixed size blocks (usually 512 bytes, 4KB etc)

Examples: Hard disks(HDD), SSDs, USB drives

5.Local Socket File(s)
----------------------
Socket files are created by programs, but we can create one using nc or Python

Example using Python:

python - << 'EOF'
import socket
s = socket.socket(socket.AF_UNIX, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.bind("mysocket.sock")
EOF

6.Named Pipe(p):
---------------
command: mkfifo mypipe

Note:
Named pipe, also called a FIFO(first in first out), is a special file in Linux used for inter-process communications(IPC)

Example:
It allows two processes to communicate:
.one process writes data into the pipe (|)
.Another process reads the data

7.Symbolic Link(l):
------------------
command: ln -s file.txt mylink
Note:
symbolic link also called soft link or symlink is special file in linux that points to another file or directory
Example: Think of it like a shortcut in windows
It does not contain real data, it stores only the path of the target file

	
Topic4: Text Editing Commands:
------------------------------
1.nano
	Edit/Create/Modify files
	Save: ctrl+x, then Y, and enter
	Exit: Ctrl+x, then N, and enter

 
2.vi
	Edit/Create/Modify files
	Once open file Begin typing: Press "I" to insert content
	Save: Esc, Shift+:, wq and enter
	Exit(wihout saving): Esc, Shift+:, q! and enter

3.vim
	Edit/Create/Modify files
	Once open file Begin typing: Press "I" to insert content
	Save: Esc, Shift+:, wq and enter
	Exit(wihout saving): Esc, Shift+:, q! and enter


difference between
Feature:				vi:						vim:
-------------------------------------------------------------
Meaning					Visual Editor			Vi Improved
Syntax highlighting		No						Yes
Undo levels				Single undo				multiple undo
Search highlighting		No						Yes
Multi-windows support	No						yes
User Interface			Very limited			Feature-rich	


Topic5: File Permissions:
-------------------------
Linux file permissions control who can read, write, or execute a file or directory
These permission are crucial for system security and user management

Types of permissions & Users
----------------------------
Three Types of permissions:

	.Read(r): View contents of a file/directory
	.Write(w): Modify file or add/remove in directory
	.Execute(x): Run file (script/program) or access directory

Three Types of Users:

	.Owner(user): who created the file/owner of the file
	.Group: User in files group
	.Others: All other users not a owner or not in group

Permission Format:
------------------	
use ls -l to see permission (E.g., -rwxrw-r--)

Breakdown: (-rwxrw-r--)

Symbol			Meaning
-				Regular file (d for directory)
rwx				Owner: read, write, Execute
rw-				Group: read, write, No permission
r--				Others: read, No permission, No permission

Numeri(Octal) Notation:
-----------------------
Each permission had a value:

	. r=4
	. w=2
	. x=1    Total value is '7'

To set permissions: "chmod 755 filename"

	Owner: rwx(7=4+2+1)
	Group: r-x(5=4+0+1)
	Others:r-x(5=4+0+1)
	
	Full permission: 777
	Zero permission: 000

Symbolic	Numeric	Permissions
,---	0	None
,--x	1	Execute
,-w-	2	Write
,-wx	3	Write+Execute
r--	4	Read
r-x	5	read+Execute
rw-	6	read+write
rwx	7	read+write+Execute

Changing Permission and Ownership:
---------------------------------
View permission: "ls -ls"
Change permission: "chmod [options] [permission] file"
Change Owner: chown user file


Topic:6
-------
$: This is normal user with limited permissions
#: Super user/root user with all permissions

To convert normal user to super/root user: "sudo su"

Topic:7 copy, move or rename files and directories
---------------------------------------------------
1.copy commands(cp)
	.cp raju shiva
	
2.copy file to directory
	.cp shiva /path/to/dir
	.cp shiva /home/ec2-user/nexgen
	
3.copy Multiple files
	.cp dinesh naresh raju /home/ec2-user/nexgen
	
4.Move a file
	.mv shiva /home/ec2-user/nexgen

5.Move a directory
	.mv nexgen /home/ec2-user/yash/priya

6.Rename commands(mv)
Linux does not have a separate rename command; mv is used for renaming

rename a file:
	.mv oldname newname
	
remove a directory(old)	

Topic:8 Reporting File system disk space usage
----------------------------------------------
Learn how to check disk and memory usage easily on linux

Disk space usage commands:
	.df -h : Report file system disk space usage (human readable)
	.du -h : Estimate file space usage(human readable)
	
Memory Usage Commands:
	.free : Display amount of free and used memory in the system
	.free -h : Human readable memory output
	.free -k : Display memory in kilobytes(KB)
	.free -m : Display memory usage in megabytes(MB)
	.free -g : Display memory usage in gigabytes(GB)
